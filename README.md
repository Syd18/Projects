Few real-world optimization case were studied and solved through deploying different meta-heuristics algorithms (GA, PSO, DE) and direct search method (Nedler Mead)

(i) Single Objective Optimization (Unconstrained and Constrained) 
    
    - Case 1: Opimization of Machinability Indices (CF,SR & CT) during Turning Of Hastealloy X Under Different Cooling Environments
   
    - Case 2: 

(ii) Multi-objective Optimization (Unconstrained)
    
    - Case 1:
    
    - Case 2:
 
 (iii) Multi-objective Optimization (Constrained)
    
    - Case 1:
    
    - Case 2:
