## Project Optimization
Few real-world optimization (Continuous) cases were studied and solved through deploying different meta-heuristics algorithms (GA, PSO, DE) and direct search method (Nedler Mead)

(i) Single Objective Optimization (Unconstrained and Constrained) 
    
(ii) Multi-objective Optimization (Unconstrained and Constrained)
